# Backlog

- Add game obstacles and objectives
  - From below
    - Shark fin or shadow
    - Whirlpool
  - From above
    - Rain drops (collectable)
    - Lightning bolt (avoid)
    - Stars and music note

- Fix spritesheet (jumpiness)
- Crop top of wave images (improves overlap detection)

Other Ideas:
- Game where you place multiple beacons in which waves will be emitted and the goal is to have the interference hit at certain spots
